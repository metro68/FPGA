# FPGA_Intro
The project aims to show an understanding of how bidirectional buses work, and how tristate logic is used to avoid contention on a bus shared by multiple data sources (RAM, EPROM and switches) and sinks (RAM, and LEDs). It will also give you an opportunity to develop your skills in SystemVerilog, and provide you with experience of digital systems which use a separate data, address and control bus.

Aims, Learning Outcomes and Outline
This project aims to:
• give you an introduction to the practicalities of a digital bus system;
• give you experience of a tristate bus, including controlling its operation;
• provide you with opportunities to extend your FPGA design skills.
Having successfully completed the project, you will be able to:
• understand how a bidirectional data bus works;
• understand how enabled flip-flops work;
• understand the transfer of data across a data bus;
• design a state machine for controlling data transfers between multiple sources and sinks;
• control the reading and writing of RAM data.
In this lab, you will understand how bidirectional buses work, and how tristate logic is used to
avoid contention on a bus shared by multiple data sources (RAM, EPROM and switches) and
sinks (RAM, and LEDs). It will also give you an opportunity to develop skills in
SystemVerilog, and provide you with experience of digital systems which use a data, address and
control bus.
